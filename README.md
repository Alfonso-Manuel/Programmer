# Programmer
This is my repository where you can find examples of programs that i have done. And some of my own history.
As a programmer I have made programs in Cobol and rpg.
For Computers AS/400 or iseries of IBM.
Lately I have been learning PowerShell and Python. I think they are the future.
Wait until i can share my programs with all the community.
